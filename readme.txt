My program cell.cpp is a C++ program that prompts the user for a phone number and uses that 
number to test the cell function

The cell function takes a string and checks if that string is a valid  phone number or not,
if it is valid it returns the phone number E. 164 format other wise it returns an empty string

The string is considered valid if it contains only 10 positive integers. 
To make my function more user friendly it removes any white spaces from the input
It also ignores pranthesis and dash if the string is in this format (000)000-000 or (000) 000-000 
(Note: there is a space after the first 3 digits in the second example)
